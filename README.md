# jekyll-travis-ci-rsync
Deploy Jekyll website to both GitHub Page (gh-pages branch) and self-hosting Virtual Private Server using Travis CI and rsync command. 

## Quick Notes
The purpose of this repo is to give you an example of integrating Jekyll, GitHub and TravisCI. The example scripts and config files are based on a fantastic theme called minimal-mistakes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes). Notice that the theme itself also uses TravisCI to automate testing procedure, which is awesome. 

## Demo Site
[JellyBlog](https://nichenjie.com/) which is also open-sourced on GitHub.
